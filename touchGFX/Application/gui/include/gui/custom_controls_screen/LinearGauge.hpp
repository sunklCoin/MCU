/**     
 * The purpose of the LinearGauge widget is to provide an application 
 * developer with means of advancing and declining values in a linear, 
 * graphical fashion. Possible directions are: North, South, East, West. 
 * The application developer supplies a background image for the gauge 
 * as well as an image of the movable part of the gauge. The widget supports 
 * a linear ease-in equation and for animating between set gauge-values. 
 * An animations length is determined by a configurable duration. 

 * A developer can ask the LinearGauge widget for the position of it's 
 * gauge level container in an effort to provide a visible indicator that 
 * exists outside of the widgets container. One way of implementing this 
 * could be creating a further specialization, LinearGaugeWithIndicator.
 * 
 * This widget is part of the TouchGFX Open Widget Repository.
